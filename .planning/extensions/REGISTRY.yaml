# Extensions Registry
# Schema version: 1
# Canonical source of truth for all approved skills and agents in this repo.
#
# Governance rules:
#   1. An entry MUST NOT have status: active without an approved EDR at the path listed in `edr`.
#   2. All fields marked "(required)" must be populated before an entry is committed.
#   3. `wiring_targets` must list at least one agent name for any active skill.
#   4. Registry changes are additive-only (new entries, status updates, deprecation fields).
#      Deletions require a superseding EDR.
#
# Bootstrap state: The registry is intentionally empty until the first EDR is approved.
# Add the first real entry when EDR-YYYYMMDD-0001-<slug>.md is approved.
#
# Example entry (commented out — copy and uncomment when registering a real extension):
